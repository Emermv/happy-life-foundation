Last December 22 we brought fun and love through a Christmas chocolate out of the mold, where children from the Villa Maria del Triunfo-Peru District, not only received gifts, enjoyed a Christmas show but also got to know about rugby, play it and have fun üòÄüë´üë¨üë≠üèâ.
<br> Thanks to each contribution of resources and time, it really all added up and together we made an unforgettable morning that left a sports seed in these children.
We want to give special thanks to @carlitosmondano for managing with Lima2019 to open the doors of the Rugby field, to the #elrugbyteencontro team for their support in the logistics and organization of the event, to the girls of @alumni_femenino, @bettymorit @ cuneocecilia Eliana, Marita, for her unconditionality üôè. To our photographers and youtubers, thanks for all the good disposition and service; To @yiddaeslavap - AYNI, @ sanjorge_peru, Yorry for their donations, they are the maximum when their help was requested they did not hesitate to do it !! üëèüëèüëèüíñ and to each person who sent us donations of all kinds üëêüòä. This experience fills our hearts with love and hope and confirms that love is the most powerful force in the world.");
